2,Jay Richard,Initially..change of address takes up to two weeks for your mail to get to the new address. Once in the system should only see an extra 2 to three days. But if letters or packages have an endorsement\return service requested\ you won't get it forwarded to you because the mailer wants it back. Best thing to do is let everyone know your new address so it doesn't slow things down.

78,Michelle Williams,Toa-Tilz Tuitupou the USPS ( United states postal service) only handles packages within the United States. If your package is in Sweden the USPS has no way to help you. They do not operate in foreign countries and once a package hits customs it is completely out of the hands of the USPS. Any updates to a scan from the time it hits customs is done by another company. Maybe your package is sitting in sweden waiting for transport to New Zealand? With Covid 19 international shipping is extremely backed up. They are backed up for months. Many countries won't allow unloading of packages so they sit in a location until the country allows packages in.

530,Kelly Clifford,Evans Marcel Evans Marcel I know what I'm talking about so I will attempt to explain to you the sequence of events regarding International deliveries: You order something from the U.S. it then travels thru the USPS system until it reaches U.S. Customs. Once it reaches Customs it must pass inspection and can be held there for a lengthy period of time. USPS and Customs are two ENTIRELY separate entities therefore USPS has absolutely no control as to how long items may remain there. Once it's released from Customs it will be placed on a CONTRACTED carrier comprised of ZERO USPS employees for transport to the destination country. By law USPS neither owns NOR operates their own aircraft. Once it reaches the destination country(in this case Nigeria) it will be handed off to Nigerian Customs for inspection and possible dues. Once THEY release it it will be handed off to Nipost in this case for final delivery to you. There is also a global pandemic occurring which has hit the United States especially hard and has slowed many things down. In closing I truly appreciate the kind words you uttered to \please close your mouth if you don't know what \your\ saying.\ You might be wise to follow that advice in this case. ,2020-05-21,1,Evans Marcel,21.0,5.0,3.0,evans marcel evans marcel know talk attempt explain sequence events regard international deliveries order something u travel thru usps system reach u customs reach customs must pass inspection hold lengthy period time usps customs two entirely separate entities therefore usps absolutely control long items may remain release customs place contract carrier comprise zero usps employees transport destination country law usps neither own operate aircraft reach destination country case nigeria hand nigerian customs inspection possible dues release hand nipost case final delivery also global pandemic occur hit unite state especially hard slow many things close truly appreciate kind word utter please close mouth know say might wise follow advice case,0.119,0.688,subjective,positive

Makes me wonder if it was them that tore open a package that had $40.00 of product in it that was a 1st class package and left me with a invoice and a torn open package in my box. Ironic how the post master of the local office couldn't follow up with that. Don't get me started on international package handling and 'losing' the package because they couldn't wait two minutes for someone to get to the door in time to sign for an item. Might want to talk to your staff at the New Baltimore MI location on how to 'improve' and education themselves on how to better handle packages. If I had a better option to use for my customers I would switch. Ever since I moved to this area I've been beyond disgusted with the service. I never had problems where I lived previously and even left our woman on our route cookies every year at Christmas because I appreciated her services and she was kind enoufge to stop one of our dogs from going on the road and walked with him up to the house.

What i am saying is usps very obviously knows when they change their expected delivery time frame to reflect accurately of 30 days and not 4 they will lose business and they are making the judgement call to be dishonest knowing their limitations.

2053,Cole Sanford,Parcels are typically not scanned by customs agencies and they have no set time on how long they may take to either approve or deny the shipping/acceptance of a package. Additionally unless a nation has a joint tracking arrangement with the USPS typically by those that participate in E-USPS DELCON INTL there wouldn't be any scans following the scans in the US-based international shipping hub. A list of these nations is available online but off the top of my head I do not believe your nation's postal service participates. A parcel from the United States would typically follow the organizational chain of USPS -> USCBP -> receiving nation customs -> receiving nation postal service. The primary issue here is that should your parcel have been processed through one of the five major international shipping hubs in the United States the USPS is no longer in possession of your parcels. ,2020-05-04,3,,4.0,5.0,0.0,parcel typically scan customs agencies set time long may take either approve deny ship acceptance package additionally unless nation joint track arrangement usps typically participate e usps delcon intl scan follow scan us base international ship hub list nations available online top head believe nation postal service participate parcel unite state would typically follow organizational chain usps uscbp receive nation customs receive nation postal service primary issue parcel process one five major international ship hubs unite state usps longer possession parcel,0.001,0.436,objective,positive

Article 1 of the Constitution gives Congress the power to establish the Postal service. This job is taken quite seriously.

Mary Van Parys-Niven all that is good but we must address the real issue. In 2006 republicans passed the Postal accountability and enhancement act.

If the package is in a foreign country you must contact that country's postal system for updates. If a package is scanned in Ireland the Ireland postal service is the one who updated the scan. The same scan is valid in both countries so you will get a scan from start to finish but once it has entered customs it is out of USPS hands. There are no USPS employees in foreign countries scanning and delivering packages. Maybe an example will be better.. I order a package from Australia.

The United States Postal Service can't help me until the package enters the United States. If the package is in the United States I have to contact the USPS. The Australian post can't help me even though it was the original country the package was sent from. Only the postal service where the package currently is can help me with the tracking.

2666,Val Nostdahl,Joseph Currier to answer your question is going back in history of the prefunding mandate. Most do not know the connection to big oil and the control of politics by Koch oil brothers specifically on the prefunding. GW Bush got in to office by gerrymandering and support of Koch oil Which also means his main interest as previously to that came in to play by his total support of Koch oil cover ups as a Governor of Texas as well. The background of the false prefunding fiasco on the postal service happened after GW Bush in 2001 2002 forced postal workers to pay in extra to retirement by a 1997 budget reconciliation act law ( NALC Legislative fact sheet 2003) Postal Workers had a 15 percent tax placed on their federal checks to create a postal surplus in the treasury for 2 years. Out of this surplus then GW Bush took 95 billion to help pay for the false Iraq oil war. Which killed millions as well as gave millions of dollars of oil contracts to Koch oil brothers and Halliburton both connected to GW Bush. GW Bush went on to raise stamp rates 2x to try to cover the deficit to postal retirements. When that did not work  he forced the ALEC Koch lobbied for false prefunding law on the USPS. The USPS had over paid its retirement accounts this was also checked out by Office of Personal Management and the Government Accounting office along with anther accountant that the USPS hired. Because of the overpayments legislation was required to give the USPS credit as well as legislation discount on payments in to retirement accounts. This meant the USPS was to get a one time payment of 5 billion to be paid over 40 years time. But with ALEC Koch lobby efforts to destroy the USPS ( Board members of ALEC or the American Legislative Exchange Council a think tank paid for by Koch oil are UPS and FedEX and Koch oil ) so with the influence of ALEC Koch GW Bush put the false accounting PAEA law on the USPS making it pay 5 billion a year from 2006 through 2016. Some payments were not made due to economics of keeping the USPS afloat. Trump then is connected to Koch oil brothers in many ways in his administration and wants to use Heritage foundation plans to try to privatize the USPS for the very ones that placed the false prefunding on the USPS in the first place. Heritage foundation is funded by Koch oil. ,2020-05-14,0,Joseph Currier,14.0,5.0,3.0,joseph currier answer question go back history prefunding mandate know connection big oil control politics koch oil brothers specifically prefunding gw bush get office gerrymander support koch oil also mean main interest previously come play total support koch oil cover up governor texas well background false prefunding fiasco postal service happen gw bush 2001 2002 force postal workers pay extra retirement 1997 budget reconciliation act law nalc legislative fact sheet 2003 postal workers 15 percent tax place federal check create postal surplus treasury 2 years surplus gw bush take 95 billion help pay false iraq oil war kill millions well give millions dollars oil contract koch oil brothers halliburton connect gw bush gw bush go raise stamp rat 2x try cover deficit postal retirements work force alec koch lobby false prefunding law usps usps pay retirement account also check office personal management government account office along anther accountant usps hire overpayments legislation require give usps credit well legislation discount payments retirement account mean usps get one time payment 5 billion pay 40 years time alec koch lobby efforts destroy usps board members alec american legislative exchange council think tank pay koch oil up fedex koch oil influence alec koch gw bush put false account paea law usps make pay 5 billion year 2006 2016 payments make due economics keep usps afloat trump connect koch oil brothers many ways administration want use heritage foundation plan try privatize usps ones place false prefunding usps first place heritage foundation fund koch oil,-0.11,0.372,objective,negative

2669,Why Privatizing Postal Service Is Not An Option,The Postal Service views the prefunding requirement as so onerous that Brennan warned Congress a year ago that the agency would run out of cash by 2024 if lawmakers did not change the mandate. There are other measures Congress could take to ease the burden on the Post Office as well. It could amend or abandon the 2006 requirement that the agency prefund its retiree health care benefits. In fact the U.S. House overwhelmingly approved legislation in February  before the wave of coronavirus-related closings stalled the economy  to get rid of the requirement. It passed on a 309-106 floor vote with support from both Democrats and Republicans. The U.S. Senate has not acted on a similar measure which is sponsored by a Democrat and a Republican. So Congress included the $10 billion for a potential loan instead.

3009,Gillian Gaar,Thank you for your concern. So if they wanted to eliminate frustration on the part of their customers they could add a notation in the About section or as a pinned post that if you need help you shouldn't post on the page you should contact them directly. As other businesses do answer questions on their fb pages so it would be especially wise to point that out. When you go to the US Postal Service fb page there is a button on the top right saying \Send Message\ and in the \About\ box there are 3 ways to contact them (phone msg website).

3466,Kelly Clifford,Chris Schultz Actually Chris it IS still a majority of their revenue and the most profitable part of their business. While package revenue has increased the profit margin isn nearly as great as it is for their stamp sales due to the steep discounts that USPS offers shippers such as UPS and FedEX to perform the \last mile delivery\ for them. The special deal with Amazon is another example of the steep discounts offered certain shippers. The simple fact of the labor involved with package delivery as compared to simply delivering letters and flats also plays a large part. But if youe needing to get in touch with someone to talk to you can always contact or visit your local post office and ask to speak with a manager. ,2020-01-21,0,Chris Schultz,21.0,1.0,1.0,chris schultz actually chris still majority revenue profitable part business package revenue increase profit margin nearly great stamp sales due steep discount usps offer shippers up fedex perform last mile delivery special deal amazon another example steep discount offer certain shippers simple fact labor involve package delivery compare simply deliver letter flats also play large part youe need get touch someone talk always contact visit local post office ask speak manager,0.146,0.358,objective,positive

3543,Welcome | USPS,Hubby moved our cameras around and we caught people actually getting our mail and giving it to us. But him throwing our mail on the wet ground or licking it and such is going to stop. Ever since then our mail started coming up missing. It was a few bills and I called about not recieving them then it was packages. But then when people started showing up putting mail in our boxes we knew there was a problem. The more I called the worse it got. We know it is retailiation for reporting him last year for not reporting a threat on our life. His supervisor stated he had no obligation to file the death threat that was told to him by a neighbor. Yes our one neighbor gates our cameras. He told the mailman he won't be delivering mail to us much longer because we called the police on him and he has a few young men who will be getting rid of them. Nora Jordin I have. It's upsetting that they are trying to hush this up. We have a huge problem in our little town with a drug epidemic. The carrier and the supervisor are both either incompetent under the influence of something or in bed together. My video doesn't lie nor would we lie on something like this. I know accusing filing false reports or slandering could result in an arrest.

I 100% understand why they cannot provide it right now but that doesnt change the fact that theyre deliberately taking money for a service they know is impossible to provide. They should not be doing that. Obviously customs probably in both countries affects it but judging from the tracking it took like 12 days to go a few hundred kilometres down the road from where it was mailed. So if its that delayed they should not be charging people for a service they know they cannot provide.

Never even spoke to me about the issue. 3 more employees check to see if he is in the building and cannot find him now. One of the employees asked me why I am still waiting and that is unfair that I am sitting there like a duck waiting. He disappears into the back staff area and for 30 more minutes I wait. He didn even look at me and told me one minute. This is after 20+ mins of waiting. When I asked if he were the supervisor he said Yes and I told him I was instructed to speak to him. The supervisor came out and completely ignored me. He acted as if he were counting the customer in the area since Covid restrictions only allow up to ten in an area. One of the employees he watched do that. I was waiting by the service door to speak to the supervisor as the employee had instructed me to do.

I am going to send this email out to all the networks and maybe I can get my mail delivered as it should be. (Outgoing and Incoming) My Michigan State Refund check was hidden in between the pages of the coupons. I did not receive my Mortage statement for my march Payment! I have had mail in my mailbox that was not mine. UPDATE: I called and was able to talk to Angla Olsteene back on December 15th ish 2019. I told her that I was going to this Email out to the News networks Facebook and My YouTube Channel. She begged me to give them another chance! (I guess she does not want any media coverage on the USPS) She reassured me that the problem would be fixed/addressed. Well the issue was solved for about 1 month. However in the month of February 2020 Now this was over 8 months ago and the problem still exists. I have tried to contact Mr.Ingles on his phone number that he gave me and left 4 messages the week of December 9th. He has not returned my calls. I am at a loss for what to do PLEASE HELP! I have contacted the Post Office on Numerous occasions to no avail. The last time I talked to a postoffice reparative was back in June or July 2019. This was Sean Ingles. He had called me and his words were \ We have enough complaints on this courier now and we have started the proceedings to get her removed\ This is an unacceptable work Practice/ Ethic and we as people of the United States deserve better. Also I would say 60% of the time my mail is just crammed into my mailbox and everything inside is folded or wrinkled. *Driving the mail truck faster than 25MPH down Cornwall St. in the summer with the back door open and mail flying around inside the truck. That was quite comical! *Backing the Mail Truck up on the street to get to a mailbox that she skipped. *I have witnessed her talking on her cell phone and driving erratic on my street (45788 Cornwall St. Utica Mi 48317) *I have witnessed this same person pull into the neighbors' driveway across the street from me and throw a package onto their porch. *All the above incidents also have happened to most of the neighbors on the street. *Driving the mail truck on to my driveway and then throwing a package that hit my house. ( I have a video of her and the mail truck in my driveway but she is off-camera when she threw the package. However my neighbors have witnessed her doing this on more than one occasion) *Delivering other people's mail to my address. (I have to take time out of my day and walk or drive down the street to deliver it.) *Not taking my outgoing mail. (This resulted in a late payment to my mortgage company) *Not receiving my mail.. some items include Allstate Insurance paperwork Statements from various companies Birthday cards and Gift cards from rewards programs. This includes.... I am writing to you because I do not know where to turn. This problem has been going on for over two years and all I get is promises from the postoffice.

6802,Edward Mutchnick,usps.com Welcome | USPS I don know if all of this is due to the virus but before this we always only had communication with the USPS and never took this long. Fortunately we were not even being close to running out of stamps. We are just trying to boost their revenue and suggested to friends that they do the same. We don want to lose the USPS and if Congress doesn give it a bailout they may go out. If they do mail will be disrupted indefinitely and private carriers will not be required to deliver to every address or charge everyone the same rates either. Did I mention rates will go up dramatically. The USPS is a nonprofit organization paid for solely with revenue from stamps merchandise and services. No taxpayer money has been given to the USPS at least since 1971. Amanda Grace it seems that the stamp fulfillment may now be subcontracted out. My stamps are scheduled to arrive tomorrow. Emails coming from Honey Bee Enterprises Inc. I placed the order on April 14. It was allegedly shipped on 4/28 but I suspect the USPS did not get it until a few days ago.

6854,Charles Bruce Forster Jr.,Kat Mogstad - Your intentions are laudable but in cities like NY your suggestion creates a distraction. The mail volume here at our block (alone) at Fort Greene necessitates the carrier devote his full attention to delivery not sales. There are easily 450 residents in private houses on our block alone. Example our brownstone townhouse is #11. The next house is #11A. We are always getting our neighbor's mail which requires us to go outside sometimes in the rain or snow to be sure they receive their mail. Our regular carrier has through his experience knows THIS but substitute carriers (when he is off) often hand us the wrong mail. A similar problem for the three parcel post deliveries we get daily plus FedEx UPS and DHL. It is a really busy route. In effect we order stamps online at the USPS STAMP STORE or similar facility or by mail. Prompt service online we have our philatelic specials and supplies in a few days. Our local stations here in NY rarely have the selection of stamp specials as offered from the Philatelic Catalogue or otherwise. The PRIORITY MAIL stamps especially had best be purchased on line local stations even in our large zip code 11217 will not carry them all. Finally we have a supply of Priority Mail envelopes with ththDon'tdd postage and our return address preprinted. They are very handy under certain mailing conditions we may have. Importantly don't give up on your ideas Kat. Keep those ideas coming. Be well.

After 3 1/2 hours I was disconnected. There is no way to do it on line. It is a nightmare to deal with them. I pay extra to insure my packages because I know they are not always treated in a gentle manner. Yet I have to go through a total nightmare trying to resolve an issue that should be pretty simple.

7180,Pam Perez,Can someone tell me how to resolve a problem with a claim on package that was denied? The item was insured and arrived broken. I put a claim in and they denied it and said I had to take it to the post office and have it inspected. I know what the problem is- I realized as soon as I filed the claim I did not send a copy of the invoice for how much was paid. The buyer is in another state sent pictures of the box broken contents etc. I waited on the phone for over 3 hours and got no where with either of the people I spoke to. After 3 1/2 hours I was disconnected. There is no way to do it on line. It is a nightmare to deal with them. I pay extra to insure my packages because I know they are not always treated in a gentle manner. Yet I have to go through a total nightmare trying to resolve an issue that should be pretty simple. Help!! ,,1,,,,,someone tell resolve problem claim package deny item insure arrive break put claim deny say take post office inspect know problem realize soon file claim send copy invoice much pay buyer another state send picture box break content etc wait phone 3 hours get either people speak 3 1 2 hours disconnect way line nightmare deal pay extra insure package know always treat gentle manner yet go total nightmare try resolve issue pretty simple help,0.108,0.535,subjective,positive

7183,Pam Perez,I have done all of that. I have filed numerous claims and they were all paid- no problems. When I sell many items daily on ebay I always try to ship Priority Mail or purchase insurance. Ebay requires the buyer to send photos of the box damaged item and packing. The seller has to reimburse the buyer for the damaged item. Seller then files a claim with the Post Office. The insurance protects the seller- not the buyer. I have always done it online. In this case I made the mistake of not providing the purchase order. There is no way to correct this error on the web site. I would never ask a customer to go wait in line at a Post office during covid-19 not knowing their health etc. All I am asking is how to correct my error to be refunded for the broken item. It is obvious the box is dented on the side. Why is it so hard to do a simple thing. Three hours on the phone and get no answers and then get disconnected. Sorry but that is unacceptable. ,,0,,,,,do file numerous claim pay problems sell many items daily ebay always try ship priority mail purchase insurance ebay require buyer send photos box damage item pack seller reimburse buyer damage item seller file claim post office insurance protect seller buyer always do online case make mistake provide purchase order way correct error web site would never ask customer go wait line post office covid 19 know health etc ask correct error refund break item obvious box dent side hard simple thing three hours phone get answer get disconnect sorry unacceptable,-0.042,0.486,objective,negative
7184,Pam Perez,I am sorry but if a seller has to refund the buyer for a broken item why would a buyer go stand in line at the Post Office since they have already gotten their money?? If photos are taken by the buyer clearly showing the box packaging and broken item why would they need to return the item to the seller to file a claim? The box is damaged so obviously it would need a new box. The seller has already paid to ship and paid for insurance to cover loss and damage seller has to refund the buyer now you want buyer to return the broken item to seller at the seller's costs again or you want buyer to go stand in line at the Post office to show them the item they broke after they have already been fully refunded. I would have to be pretty lucky to have a customer do that. My point is (was) that I filed the claim but accidentally forgot to send a copy of the paid invoice along with the photos of the broken item. There is no where that you can correct your mistake or to refile. ,,9,,,,,sorry seller refund buyer break item would buyer go stand line post office since already get money photos take buyer clearly show box package break item would need return item seller file claim box damage obviously would need new box seller already pay ship pay insurance cover loss damage seller refund buyer want buyer return break item seller seller cost want buyer go stand line post office show item break already fully refund would pretty lucky customer point file claim accidentally forget send copy pay invoice along photos break item correct mistake refile,0.053,0.695,subjective,positive

7385,Larry Trowbridge Sr.,**Note: In case it is relevant to the situation above I live in a small town close enough to the P.O. that I don't get home delivery.** Tere Valdes that's an utter nonsense answer! The last two deliveries I've received (as well as numerous other times in the past BEFORE the pandemic in case you were going to use that as an excuse) from USPS have been delayed because of a supposed \incorrect address.\ It comes to a nearby town (approx. 6 miles away) and is sorted and tracking says it is \out for delivery\...at my local P.O. office. Then the next tracking information says it was returned to P.O. for incorrect address. The really odd thing is when the package does finally arrive IT HAS THE SAME ADDRESS ON IT AS ALL OF THE PREVIOUS SUCCESSFUL DELIVERIES! THE EXACT SAME ADDRESS! Since I save my packaging and take it to our local recycling bin I have proof of this. Now you want to hear something else that is borderline deceptive? Our local Post Mistress (actually a neighbor of mine and a very rare example of a truly dedicate USPS employee) said that when tracking info states it is \out for delivery\ here in my town it is not physically here and is still in the other town or still en-route here and actual error was that the package was assigned to a driver for delivery-in that town- instead of being sent here to our town where it was supposed to be. The driver notices the error and brings it back to his office and it is obviously then too late to be delivered that day and is sent out again the next day and oddly enough that same \problem\ has never happened an the second attempt. I obviously have no way of proving this but I suspect this is a 'stalling/blame shifting' tactic to buy time as it most commonly happens on a Saturday; you figure out the rest. ,2020-05-23,0,,23.0,5.0,5.0,note case relevant situation live small town close enough p get home delivery tere valdes utter nonsense answer last two deliveries receive well numerous time past pandemic case go use excuse usps delay suppose incorrect address come nearby town approx 6 miles away sort track say delivery local p office next track information say return p incorrect address really odd thing package finally arrive address previous successful deliveries exact address since save package take local recycle bin proof want hear something else borderline deceptive local post mistress actually neighbor mine rare example truly dedicate usps employee say track info state delivery town physically still town still en route actual error package assign driver delivery town instead send town suppose driver notice error bring back office obviously late deliver day send next day oddly enough problem never happen second attempt obviously way prove suspect stall blame shift tactic buy time commonly happen saturday figure rest,0.012,0.349,objective,positive

I now check with any business before I purchase and if they ship via USPS I will not buy from them. store.usps.com Replies to Daniel's comment on US Postal Service's post View post Daniel Wohlford ,2020-05-21,20,,21.0,5.0,3.0,earth would anyone ship anything via usps never receive package timely fashion ship way package ship via usps count bounce around metro area live least two days make local post office sit least another 24 hours delivery check business purchase ship via usps buy store usps com reply daniel comment us postal service post view post daniel wohlford,-0.116,0.325,objective,negative

USPS is partnering with some of the others and they're doing the actual delivery of items. It sounds like it makes sense. You're coming to my house daily anyway. It's too many fingers in the pie. My granddaughter has a package ordered through Amazon. They handed it off to their local post office on the 11th. They supposedly attempted delivery that day but the drive was blocked yet they delivered another item and although they said they would attempt delivery the next day nothing ever happened since.

8839,James Thompson,Also USPS is in the red only because of Congress. Congress modified a requirement of USPS to pre fund pensions from 30 years in advance which covered career postal workers who have several years in already so they're dedicated to their jobs estimating around 250000 employees to requiring 70 years in advance which meant all USPS employees career or non career wether they're entitled to a pension or not were being pure funded. That also meant any children of a postal employee under the age of 18 was also pre funded. That jumped the count from 250000 to well over a million people to pre fund.

Do you understand NOW I CANNOT BE IN Santa Rita in Dublin California AND SIGN OFF ON ANYTHING TO CASH A CHECK AT A BANK NOR A CHECK CASHING OFFICE. WHICH MEANS SOMEONE SEEN MY PFN (BGV486) ACTIVE IN JAIL AT THE BANK OR CHECK CASHING PLACES BECAUSE MY SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER AND MY STATE IDENTIFICATION NUMBER ARE ALL CONNECTED TO IT NOT TO MENTION MY MOBILE NUMBER AND GPS LOCATIONS V.S. THE HACKERS THAT STALK ME THAT I CALL #TeamKarina don't believe me CLICK on TeamKarina or JUST #AskSophia which ultimately means any money transferred to an account attached to my social security number is totally and completely legal withdrawing the money from my account without my acknowledgement consent or notification means that any money withdrawn from the account is completely illegal and insured which means I as a citizen within the United States within the jurisdiction in the state of California as well as within Alameda County and if they used my account outside of Alameda County or outside of California or even outside of the United States makes this completely illegal especially when I have proven proof of my physical location which means someone was using my strawman especially while I was in jail not to mention that the settlement checks are government-issued and government-insured like from juvenile hall like from Harrison homes group home Mountain Stockton San Joaquin County like from Camp Sweeney like from Alameda County Santa Rita and the fact that my birth certificate registered in 1991 July 24th in Hayward California completely contradicts my actual date of birth September 27th 1988 and the fact that my social security number was registered in Oregon not California means that I am adopted which means there is a government-issued trust fund that I never got which is government-insured and the fact that they cashed these checks and accessed my trust fund money as well as my inheritance money on both my adopted grandparent side and my biological grandparents side as well as immediate parents on both sides as well and I also notified the proper authorities on a multimedia open platform with a whole bunch of other companies and conglomerates to take Witness that I made those comments on Facebook Instagram or Twitter and the fact that I have also screenshots of most of those internet based records for dating location before I turned 30 years old because 25 is when I'm able to access all of my money right?

So THE COMPANY I ordered from choos you to deliver the package and you're mad so now me with a car that just broke down have to pay someone gas money to go take me to pick up two bottles of pills and some drops (that could've easily fit in the mailbox) or I will just have to pay extra for another company to deliver it straight to my house cause you're being asked to do what you're getting paid for? The same package TWICE they missed me when they never come near the apartments they go straight to the mailboxes areas and deliver there so how can they \miss me\? They rather send me messages saying they attempted to deliver (only God knows if they really attempted they have the keys to the mailbox did someone had to be there to pull open the mailbox for them? ) so they attempted to deliver one little bottle of drops but it was to difficult for them to insert the key inside the key hole and put the package in it they've attempted but they couldn't do it so they took one package back again and now it's no even giving me the choice to schedule a redelivery but they're the ones that are upset OK so let me go pay some one some gas money to take me to the post office so that the mail man that has the transportation to deliver a package that was paid to get delivered doesn't get upset  BRAVO ,2020-05-26,0,,26.0,5.0,1.0,well explain place couple order one amazon one walmart company decide pay usps deliver guess usps soooo mad refuse deliver package one package contain 2 bottle pills package contain medicinal drop guess ask usps put tiny light package inside mailbox much ask since normally would deliver anything directly cluster mailboxes since key unlock mailboxes put mail lock mailbox also lockers bottom mailboxes case enough space mail box normally put package throw key mailbox go get mail find locker key get package always like feed company pay deliveries prefer send message say sorry miss safe place leave package take back post office pick reschedule redelivery possibly miss never come apartment always go straight mailboxes area leave package inside mailboxes miss stand next mailboxes miss put package inside mailbox othereise miss take package pay deliver back company order choos deliver package mad car break pay someone gas money go take pick two bottle pills drop could easily fit mailbox pay extra another company deliver straight house cause ask get pay package twice miss never come near apartments go straight mailboxes areas deliver miss rather send message say attempt deliver god know really attempt key mailbox someone pull open mailbox attempt deliver one little bottle drop difficult insert key inside key hole put package attempt take one package back even give choice schedule redelivery ones upset ok let go pay one gas money take post office mail man transportation deliver package pay get deliver get upset bravo,0.026,0.573,subjective,positive
9119,Yadira Quiles,Donna Harwood I'd be patient and kind if when I track the package it says that due to covid19 the package will be delayed a few days that's very understandable but to say they attempted to deliver a small bottle of drops and they had to take it back to the post office because they missed me and there wasn't a safe place to live them twice in a row (which is a lie because they always \miss us\ since they're not allowed to bring us mail/packages directly to the apartments they go straight to the cluster mailboxes area since they have keys to all of our mailboxes and leave the packages there) that I can't understand how can he attempt to deliver a small bottle of drops directly to the mail boxes and not be able to use the key to open the mailbox to put the tiny package in it twice in a row? I don't believe he really attempted to that it is really not that difficult to unlock a mailbox put the package in and lock it again I'm sorry but I don't buy the \delivery attempts\. So now I have to pay out of pocket gas for someone to bring me to the post office to pick up this tiny drops that some mail couldn't manage to put inside mailbox now I have to BOTHER someone to take part if HIS/HER time to take me to the post office to puck up this package because the mailman doesn't want to bother to take the time that he gets paid for to c deliver this package NICE!!! ,2020-05-26,0,,26.0,5.0,1.0,donna harwood patient kind track package say due covid19 package delay days understandable say attempt deliver small bottle drop take back post office miss safe place live twice row lie always miss us since allow bring us mail package directly apartments go straight cluster mailboxes area since key mailboxes leave package understand attempt deliver small bottle drop directly mail box able use key open mailbox put tiny package twice row believe really attempt really difficult unlock mailbox put package lock sorry buy delivery attempt pay pocket gas someone bring post office pick tiny drop mail manage put inside mailbox bother someone take part time take post office puck package mailman want bother take time get pay c deliver package nice,0.066,0.58,subjective,positive

When I started I loved my job and when it ended I loved my patrons but post service mutated into something I could not imagine. The customer in customer service was totally removed from the equation. Management created an unbearable work environment. Slack offs were rewarded and workers were punished! I could go on and on. My regular sub for my off days was a total loser did nothing except sabotage my route and it would take me till my next day off to fix his deliberate mistakes. Guess what? Management did nothing. In part because they knew I was dedicated to my route and would fix the f--- up.Also PO hires 90 day wonders who either quit because they are pressured to do 12 hours work in 8 hours. Or rewarded with another 90 days. With no benefits. It is impossible to get quality competent workers in that environment. 98 % of the regulars who are still there are totally dedicated. For all the other reasons is why the public consider the USPS a present day failed and flawed system. Thank you for allowing to explain the situation.
