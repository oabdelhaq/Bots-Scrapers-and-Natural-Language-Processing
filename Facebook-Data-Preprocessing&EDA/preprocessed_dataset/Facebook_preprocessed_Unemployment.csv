2,FILING FAILURES,All of the problems that the DEO has is because they do not communicate with their clients. I have gotten 1 letter since the end of March when I filed. That was Monetary Determination now to me that paperwork shows how much I made from the company I worked for. It also showed the amount of money the DEO determined I was entitled to both weekly and maximum. There was no mention of filing an appeal or anything negative on the account. I tried for months now to contact them and I am still trying every day. I believe they do this all on purpose.

113,Ella T Johnson,Pronouns: She/Her/Hers lauren.cooper@myfloridahouse.gov Florida State House District 47 Representative Anna V. Eskamani District Senior Executive Secretary Lauren Cooper Lauren Stay safe and speak soon! We also encourage you to keep in touch with us online where we share constant updates on current events and legislative advocacy with a recent emphasis on DEO coverage. You can find our team online on Twitter Facebook and Instagram at @AnnaForFlorida. Please know that the issues with DEO are not your own fault and we are working hard and often to keep Floridians informed and hold the state accountable. Note: If you have other claim issues please consider filling out our Claim Escalation Form here which we will manually migrate into the DEO Escalation Portal to request a caseworker review your benefits ASAP. Finally we understand that this system has harmed Floridians far and wide. We are committed to systemic change and Rep. Eskamani voted yes to return to Tallahassee and fix unemployment ASAP  however this measure failed by a party line vote in May. She also joined a cohort of lawmakers in requesting more tools for lawmakers to help claimants however DEO has not since responded. It incredibly disappointing to hear that DEO continues to make mistakes with claims and wel be asking DEO to expedite the list we have sent them. From DEO: ndividuals who requested that their claims be backdated were not included in recent payment files for the Federal Pandemic Unemployment Compensation payments. We are working diligently to ensure these claimants are made whole as quickly as possible. At this time claimants do not need to do anything but should continue to request benefits as long as they are unemployed or partially unemployed. The department anticipates having the issue resolved quickly and being able to provide these payments to eligible claimants. Additionally the department has identified that some claimants were not paid their Federal Pandemic Unemployment Compensation payment for their waiting week. The department has identified these individuals and should have them paid their $600 federal payment within five business days. Earlier this evening DEO shared that there are wo technology concerns that may have prevented an individual from receiving their Federal Pandemic Unemployment Compensation payment over the last few weeks. This message is a confirmation that our team received your submission to our Missing FPUC Payments Form to request assistance with $600 payments since May 19th. We have closed the form at 9:00pm and Representative Eskamani has since shared your submitted details to the Legislative Affairs Team at DEO which liaises between lawmakers and claim caseworkers.

I realize they had no system until April 9th but that website doesn't work either. She finally submitted a PUA on 5/22/2020 and entered her date of unemployment as 3/19/2020 but the application shows an active date of 5/10/2020. She got paid for that week and 5/17 week but since she went back to work on 5/26/2020 everything stopped.

887,Ian Yarian,DEO says PUA claims for independent contractors will be automatically be paid retroactive. This is not true. My wife is a Nail Technician with a 1099-MISC from 2019 and became unemployed on 3/19/2020 due to COVID 19. She started her application on 3/29/2020 after CARES was signed. It finally went through on 4/4/2020 but was denied because she was an independent contractor. She filed on the new website as advised and that has been in \Pending - Submitted\ since 4/14/2020. She filed for PUA on 5/22/2020 and the PUA application shows she became unemployed on 3/19/2020. Even DEO guide says these are automatically made retroactive but she received two weeks of PUA starting 5/10/2020 and nothing retroactive. DEO does not answer emails and it's impossible to get through on the phone. She is back to work so PUA has stopped but she never received the retroactive payments. Her PUA application on CONNECT shows a start date of 5/10/2020. I keep seeing that these are automatically aid to the date they lost work NOT the application date but this just isn't true.

I've been under temporary furlough since April 6 2020 and still to this date I haven't seen a dime! I've been trying to talk to an actual human being every single day with no luck! I've even set my alarm at 7:30am and still get the \all our agents are currently busy and we are unable to provide the call back option\... are you for real?! All agents busy at 7:30am and busy every single hour every single day of every single week?! This is unacceptable! Today finally I'm placed on hold to talk to somebody and after an hour it rings and it seems somebody is going to pick up and the first time \hi how can I help you?\ and when I start talking the agent hangs up on me! After an hour seriously?! How disrespectful! And there I go for my second try and after an hour and ten minutes it starts ringing now it takes me to some music instead of the automatic messages so here I'm waiting and something/somebody hangs up on me AGAIN!

Ive spoken to and have called about 10 differents occasions in the last 2 weeks and spent about a good 25 hours on hold only to be promised time and time again that it is done and that ill see the results in a day or two. Had one agent name Johnny even call himself an allstar and basically call every other agent i spoke to dumb. And neither johnny nor anyone else has helped. Nothing has changed. my application is still in limbo. I am owed about 14 weeks at this point meaning im due to extend and I havent seen a dime of state benefits. They claim that it is an issue with an old claim from 2016 which I didnt even collect a penny on because i immediately began independent contractor work shortly after applying. it is ridiculous and only shows what a LOW QUALITY website and system it is we are working with that information from a claim that is over 5 years old is affecting this claim and that it has taken about 10 agents to TRY and fix it and nothing has been fixed. Im on hold now for over 2 hours waiting on a supervisor and this is the 3rd time I wait on hold for a supervisor. Yesterday after an hour and 45 minutes the agent hung up on me. This is a disgrace. I am disgusted by the florida unemployment system and most agents dont have an answer to the questions meaning they are not properly trained and should not be handling such delicate information or circumstances.

Federal says that I only eligible from when I applied for PUA on 4/26. Why doesn that start from the time I first applied. I literally applied for CARES grant in my county and got that within 2 weeks. Went from eligible to ineligible to pending. Ie sent in 2 (site & certified mail) proof of income.

2250,Lulu App,Also if you pay for health insurance at work make sure the amount of unemployment they're giving you is based on how much you MADE not how much you took home after paying for your health insurance. My mom pays for health insurance provided from her job and for some reason her unemployment amount was based on what she made after paying her health insurance which is incorrect. My sister also works for the mouse (disney) and pays insurance and she got the correct unemployment amount based on how much money she made without deducting the amount that went for health insurance so keep an eye our for that. We're still waiting to hear from them to fix this issue so she can get the money she is owed. -PSA. You wont see the link for PEUC until you request the funds for your last week. My last week was June 7-13 but my request date was June 22nd. I went in June 22nd and requested the funds for June 7-13 and it let me request funds for June 14-20 as well.
