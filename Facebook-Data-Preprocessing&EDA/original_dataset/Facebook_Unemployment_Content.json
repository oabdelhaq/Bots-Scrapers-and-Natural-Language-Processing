Good Evening \u2014\n\nLauren here with Representative Anna Eskamani.\n\nThis message is a confirmation that our team received your submission to our Missing FPUC Payments Form to request assistance with $600 payments since May 19th. We have closed the form at 9:00pm and Representative Eskamani has since shared your submitted details to the Legislative Affairs Team at DEO which liaises between lawmakers and claim caseworkers.\n\nEarlier this evening DEO shared that there are \u201ctwo technology concerns that may have prevented an individual from receiving their Federal Pandemic Unemployment Compensation payment over the last few weeks.\u201d\n\nFrom DEO: \u201cIndividuals who requested that their claims be backdated were not included in recent payment files for the Federal Pandemic Unemployment Compensation payments. We are working diligently to ensure these claimants are made whole as quickly as possible. At this time claimants do not need to do anything but should continue to request benefits as long as they are unemployed or partially unemployed. The department anticipates having the issue resolved quickly and being able to provide these payments to eligible claimants. Additionally, the department has identified that some claimants were not paid their Federal Pandemic Unemployment Compensation payment for their waiting week. The department has identified these individuals and should have them paid their $600 federal payment within five business days.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s incredibly disappointing to hear that DEO continues to make mistakes with claims and we\u2019ll be asking DEO to expedite the list we have sent them.\n\nNote: If you have other claim issues please consider filling out our Claim Escalation Form here which we will manually migrate into the DEO Escalation Portal to request a caseworker review your benefits ASAP. Finally we understand that this system has harmed Floridians far and wide. We are committed to systemic change and Rep. Eskamani voted yes to return to Tallahassee and fix unemployment ASAP \u2014 however this measure failed by a party line vote in May. She also joined a cohort of lawmakers in requesting more tools for lawmakers to help claimants however DEO has not since responded.\n\nPlease know that the issues with DEO are not your own fault and we are working hard and often to keep Floridians informed and hold the state accountable.\n\nWe also encourage you to keep in touch with us online where we share constant updates on current events and legislative advocacy with a recent emphasis on DEO coverage.

Had one agent name Johnny even call himself an allstar and basically call every other agent i spoke to dumb. And neither johnny nor anyone else has helped. Nothing has changed. my application is still in limbo. I am owed about 14 weeks at this point meaning im due to extend and I havent seen a dime of state benefits. They claim that it is an issue with an old claim from 2016, which I didnt even collect a penny on because i immediately began independent contractor work shortly after applying. it is ridiculous and only shows what a LOW QUALITY website and system it is we are working with that information from a claim that is over 5 years old is affecting this claim and that it has taken about 10 agents to TRY and fix it and nothing has been fixed. Im on hold now for over 2 hours waiting on a supervisor and this is the 3rd time I wait on hold for a supervisor. Yesterday, after an hour and 45 minutes, the agent hung up on me. This is a disgrace. I am disgusted by the florida unemployment system and most agents dont have an answer to the questions, meaning they are not properly trained and should not be handling such delicate information or circumstances.

So, he never had a link, and under Messages it told him to request his weeks on 6/4/2020. But there is NO LINK to do this. He has spoken to different reps, all telling him different things but no resolution of any type. The latest rep told him that his claim is \"not registered\"and that's why his payment stopped and therefore no link to claim. He mentioned this before to a different rep about it showed all along that his claim is not registered, but a prior rep told him that's okay since it's showing he's eligible, which he is, and receiving payments. However, the latest rep told him he needs to get with a supervisor and it could be a 4 hour wait, so \"maybe call back tomorrow when it's less busy as I leave at 3:30 and if I can't get a supervisor I won't be able to help you.\" Seriously? I am convinced that these reps get commission if we give up and not pursue anything as DEO does not want to pay out...period.

My mom pays for health insurance provided from her job and for some reason her unemployment amount was based on what she made after paying her health insurance which is incorrect. My sister also works for the mouse (disney) and pays insurance and she got the correct unemployment amount, based on how much money she made without deducting the amount that went for health insurance,, so keep an eye our for that.

You wont see the link for PEUC until you request the funds for your last week. My last week was June 7-13 but my request date was June 22nd. I went in June 22nd and requested the funds for June 7-13 and it let me request funds for June 14-20 as well. No link for PEUC had shown up yet. The following date I go in and the link finally showed up. It asked me 19 yes or no questions and once I submitted it I went back to my home page and boom, I was already enrolled in PEUC. My balanced (benefit amount) went up for 13 weeks, my claim status is now \"exhausted_active\" and the program type is now \"Pandemic EUC.\" Instead of getting paid for my two weeks at once how I normally did my funds for the week of June 7-13 showed up on my bank account on June 24 and the funds for the week of June 14-20 is currently pending to be deposited on my bank account. My fund request date has also been moved up a week so instead of going in in July to request my two weeks, I go back in on the 29th.\n\nAlso, if you pay for health insurance at work make sure the amount of unemployment they're giving you is based on how much you MADE, not how much you took home after paying for your health insurance. My mom pays for health insurance provided from her job and for some reason her unemployment amount was based on what she made after paying her health insurance which is incorrect. My sister also works for the mouse (disney) and pays insurance and she got the correct unemployment amount, based on how much money she made without deducting the amount that went for health insurance,, so keep an eye our for that.
