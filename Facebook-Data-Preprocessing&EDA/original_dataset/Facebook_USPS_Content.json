Here's a thought, stop losing people's packages! And if you do happen to lose a package, when you tell people to file a claim, actually look for the package or replaced the value of the item! How many items have I sent to customers that just disappeared when they went to Fayetteville or Charlotte. As a small business owner it kind of digs into your pocket when you have to replace items several times a year because they were lost in transit! Do your job better and then maybe Americans wouldn't mind spending money with the post office!

Once in the system should only see an extra 2 to three days. But if letters or packages have an endorsement\"return service requested\" you won't get it forwarded to you because the mailer wants it back.

We, and our neighbors on either side, have been labelled as \"inaccessible\". I have called the national 1-800 number more than once. I have even gone to the local office, in person, to specifically pick up one package.\n\nOnly one end of our street is blocked. Getting to us and our neighbors require a 3-minute detour to the other end of our street. I have informed both the local branch and the 1-800 number of this. At no point have I been told of any solution, nor been given my mail.\n\nYesterday, I got a visit from a crew chief of the contractors doing the water main. They went to the local branch, and spoke to the \"manager\", that refused to give their name. Only then did we find out that we were expected to come pick up our mail.\n\n1) Our home is accessible, with a minor detour.\n2) That manager said we would be informed; its been more than 2 weeks, and I have been there in person. That manager is blatantly and overtly lying.\n3) This roadblock will be expanding over the course of the next year or more.

Once it reaches Customs, it must pass inspection, and can be held there for a lengthy period of time. USPS and Customs are two ENTIRELY separate entities, therefore, USPS has absolutely no control as to how long items may remain there. Once it's released from Customs, it will be placed on a CONTRACTED carrier, comprised of ZERO USPS employees, for transport to the destination country. By law, USPS neither owns NOR operates their own aircraft. Once it reaches the destination country(in this case Nigeria), it will be handed off to Nigerian Customs for inspection and possible dues. Once THEY release it, it will be handed off to Nipost, in this case, for final delivery to you. There is also a global pandemic occurring, which has hit the United States especially hard, and has slowed many things down. In closing, I truly appreciate the kind words you uttered to \"please close your mouth if you don't know what \"your\" saying.\" You might be wise to follow that advice in this case.\n1 \u00b7 Like \u00b7 React \u00b7 More \u00b7 May 21", "Replies to \u0420\u043e\u043c\u0430's comment on US Postal Service's post View post", "\u0420\u043e\u043c\u0430 \u041e\u0441\u043e\u0432'\u044f\u043a\nWhere is my international package RC064451816UA ?! what a terrible service ?!\n3 \u00b7 Like \u00b7 React \u00b7 More \u00b7 May 20", "", "Audra Leonard\n\u0420\u043e\u043c\u0430 \u041e\u0441\u043e\u0432'\u044f\u043a um, it's still in your own terrible country.\n4 \u00b7 Like \u00b7 React \u00b7 More \u00b7 May 20", "\u0420\u043e\u043c\u0430 \u041e\u0441\u043e\u0432'\u044f\u043a\nmedia1.tenor.co\nmedia1.tenor.co\nLike \u00b7 React \u00b7 More \u00b7 May 21", "media1.tenor.co\nmedia1.tenor.co", "\u0420\u043e\u043c\u0430 \u041e\u0441\u043e\u0432'\u044f\u043a\nAudra Leonard Did you look at yourself in the mirror ?!

But, it amazes me how victims create their own victimization by staying in toxic relationships. (I\u2019m guilty of that too. It\u2019s a human flaw.)

What i am saying is usps very obviously knows when they change their expected delivery time frame to reflect accurately of 30 days and not 4 they will lose business, and they are making the judgement call to be dishonest knowing their limitations.

Additionally, unless a nation has a joint tracking arrangement with the USPS, typically by those that participate in E-USPS DELCON INTL, there wouldn't be any scans following the scans in the US-based international shipping hub. A list of these nations is available online, but off the top of my head, I do not believe your nation's postal service participates.\n3 \u00b7 Like \u00b7 React \u00b7 More \u00b7 May 4", "Kat Fiebig\nMany countries have stopped accepting mail into their country.

I\u2019ve heard conflicting stories from different usps reps. I was told what you wrote at usps when I shipped my boxes. Upon calling customer service they said I would see tracking updates. 1/7 boxes I shipped arrived in Australia. The rest were marked as received and processed in Miami. Why would one box make it and have tracking updates but not the other 6? It seems contradictory. Would appreciate your input, thank you! Cole Sanford\nEdited \u00b7 Like \u00b7 React \u00b7 More \u00b7 May 5", "Cole Sanford\nJenny, I could offer a few guesses at the most likely causes of delays. Firstly your packages made it to Miami, which is one of the 5 international hubs, so at least there's that.\n\nAs for only 1/7 making it to Australia thus far, there's a few reasons I think of. AUSPOST does participate in joint tracking with USPS, so as long as your parcels have Priority Mail, or another eligible tracking, (Which it would seem they do if 1/7 have been scanned in) anything that's been processed through Miami but not accepted by AUSPOST would be in either the hands of USCBP or ABF(?). It's not uncommon for multiple parcels sent at the same time to end up separated during shipping; all it takes is an automated conveyer plopping the package in a different hamper. Additionally, customs clears/denies packages individually, and they don't always score high marks for being prompt.\n\nFinally, due to the ongoing pandemic, (again, speculation) should your packages have been cleared by USCBP, but split up in the process, they may not have made it on the same plane. With air travel greatly reduced, the commercial airliners that a lot of First Class/Priority mail are loaded onto simply aren't flying, greatly reducing shipping throughput. It's possible your remaining packages are waiting for a plane to be able to even physically move them to Australia.\n\nIt's probably not a great comfort that I cannot offer much more than speculation, but outside the rare direct reply from the marketing account, USPS employees responding here are doing so on their own time, just as people with institutional knowledge, but no current access to non-public postal systems, etc.\nEdited \u00b7 1 \u00b7 Like \u00b7 React \u00b7 More \u00b7 May 5", "Jenny Stanwix\nCole Sanford thank you!!!

The background of the false prefunding fiasco on the postal service, happened after GW Bush in 2001, 2002, forced postal workers to pay in extra to retirement by a 1997 budget reconciliation act law ( NALC Legislative fact sheet 2003) Postal Workers had a 15 percent tax placed on their federal checks to create a postal surplus in the treasury for 2 years. Out of this surplus then GW Bush took 95 billion to help pay for the false Iraq oil war. Which killed millions as well as gave millions of dollars of oil contracts to Koch oil brothers and Halliburton, both connected to GW Bush. GW Bush went on to raise stamp rates 2x to try to cover the deficit to postal retirements. When that did not work , he forced the ALEC Koch lobbied for false prefunding law on the USPS. The USPS had over paid its retirement accounts, this was also checked out by Office of Personal Management, and the Government Accounting office along with anther accountant that the USPS hired. Because of the overpayments, legislation was required to give the USPS credit as well as legislation discount on payments in to retirement accounts. This meant the USPS was to get a one time payment of 5 billion to be paid over 40 years time. But with ALEC Koch lobby efforts to destroy the USPS ( Board members of ALEC or the American Legislative Exchange Council a think tank paid for by Koch oil, are UPS and FedEX and Koch oil ) so with the influence of ALEC Koch, GW Bush put the false accounting PAEA law on the USPS, making it pay 5 billion a year from 2006 through 2016. Some payments were not made due to economics of keeping the USPS afloat. Trump then is connected to Koch oil brothers, in many ways in his administration, and wants to use Heritage foundation plans to try to privatize the USPS for the very ones that placed the false prefunding on the USPS in the first place. Heritage foundation is funded by Koch oil.\nLike \u00b7 React \u00b7 More \u00b7 May 14", "Val Nostdahl\nRobert Woods, the NALC union at the time of the false prefunding went along with it.

It passed on a 309-106 floor vote, with support from both Democrats and Republicans./The Post Office faces several unique circumstances that make a bailout harder for it to secure than other companies or government agencies. Those start with an extraordinary requirement Congress imposed on the Postal Service in 2006 that requires the agency to prefund health benefits for its retirees for the next 75 years \u2014 including those who haven\u2019t been born yet \u2014 something that\u2019s unheard of in the public or private sector.\n\nAnd lately those obstacles also include a president who is fixated on the Post Office and its business model for delivering packages, because the president believes it benefits one of his perceived enemies.\n\nThose special circumstances also make it hard for outsiders to gauge just how difficult it would be for Congress to address the situation.\n\nBrennan told a House committee that the Postal Service would run out of money by the end of the federal fiscal year on Sept. 30. The bipartisan board that oversees the postal agency \u2014 whose members were appointed by Trump \u2014 recently asked Congress for:\n\n$25 billion of emergency money to offset coronavirus-related losses;\nanother $25 billion to pay for building projects to modernize the Postal Service (the last time the agency upgraded its fleet of mail trucks, for example, was in 1987);\nand up to $25 billion in loans from the U.S. Treasury.\nBut according to The Washington Post, Trump threatened to veto a $2 trillion economic relief act passed by Congress in March if it contained money specifically designated to keep the Postal Service afloat./President Trump has blocked potential emergency funding for the agency that employs around 600,000 workers, repeating instead the false claim that higher rates for Internet shipping companies Amazon, FedEx and UPS would right the service\u2019s budget,\u201d the Post reported. (The president has repeatedly complained that Amazon benefits from the Postal Service\u2019s rate structure, a complaint that seems to be related to the fact that Amazon owner Jeff Bezos also owns The Washington Post.)\n\nSo Congress included the $10 billion for a potential loan, instead.\n\nThere are other measures Congress could take to ease the burden on the Post Office as well. It could amend or abandon the 2006 requirement that the agency prefund its retiree health care benefits. In fact, the U.S. House overwhelmingly approved legislation in February \u2014 before the wave of coronavirus-related closings stalled the economy \u2014 to get rid of the requirement. It passed on a 309-106 floor vote, with support from both Democrats and Republicans. The U.S. Senate has not acted on a similar measure, which is sponsored by a Democrat and a Republican.\n\nThe Postal Service views the prefunding requirement as so onerous that Brennan warned Congress a year ago that the agency would run out of cash by 2024 if lawmakers did not change the mandate.\nEdited \u00b7 Like \u00b7 React \u00b7 More \u00b7 May 14", "Val Nostdahl\nThe prefunding mandate is responsible for 100% of the Postal Service\u2019s net losses\u201d between 2013 and the coronavirus hitting earlier this year, wrote the American Postal Workers Union in a statement. The Postal Service has not paid the money it owes for those benefits since 2012, so it shows up as a debt on the agency\u2019s balance sheets. (Of the more than $120 billion the agency owed for retirement benefits in 2018, more than $66 billion was for retiree health benefits.)/Many have died in the USPS due to the false prefunding mandate , non staffing in the USPS because of the false prefunding .

I have filed a complaint and a missing package form. Now I am finding that a birthday card I sent on the 20th of December to be there for the 30th has not been delivered.

The mail volume here at our block (alone) at Fort Greene necessitates the carrier devote his full attention to delivery, not sales. There are easily 450 residents in private houses on our block alone. Example our brownstone townhouse is #11. The next house is #11A. We are always getting our neighbor's mail, which requires us to go outside, sometimes in the rain or snow to be sure they receive their mail. Our regular carrier has, through his experience knows THIS, but substitute carriers (when he is off) often hand us the wrong mail. A similar problem for the three parcel post deliveries we get daily, plus FedEx, UPS, and DHL. It is a really busy route. In effect we order stamps online at the USPS STAMP STORE or similar facility, or by mail. Prompt service, online, we have our philatelic specials and supplies in a few days. Our local stations here in NY rarely have the selection of stamp specials as offered from the Philatelic Catalogue or otherwise. The PRIORITY MAIL stamps especially had best be purchased on line, local stations even in our large zip code 11217, will not carry them all. Finally, we have a supply of Priority Mail envelopes with ththDon'tdd postage and our return address preprinted. They are very handy under certain mailing conditions we may have.

Even in areas where the Post Office says they provide delivery service, it often is not actually to the address, but simply to a supposedly \"nearby\" location where the Post Office requires people to have a mail box, which may not even by on the same road as their address.\n\nThe USPS is a semi-private operation combining the worst aspects of both government and private institutions.

The last two deliveries I've received (as well as numerous other times in the past BEFORE the pandemic in case you were going to use that as an excuse) from USPS have been delayed because of a supposed \"incorrect address.\" It comes to a nearby town (approx. 6 miles away) and is sorted and tracking says it is \"out for delivery\"...at my local P.O. office. Then, the next tracking information says it was returned to P.O. for incorrect address. The really odd thing is, when the package does finally arrive, IT HAS THE SAME ADDRESS ON IT AS ALL OF THE PREVIOUS SUCCESSFUL DELIVERIES! THE EXACT SAME ADDRESS! Since I save my packaging and take it to our local recycling bin, I have proof of this. Now, you want to hear something else, that is borderline deceptive? Our local Post Mistress (actually a neighbor of mine and a very rare example of a truly dedicate USPS employee) said that when tracking info states it is \"out for delivery\" here in my town, it is not physically here, and is still in the other town or still en-route here and actual error was that the package was assigned to a driver for delivery-in that town- instead of being sent here to our town where it was supposed to be. The driver notices the error and brings it back to his office and it is obviously then too late to be delivered that day and is sent out again the next day, and oddly enough, that same \"problem\" has never happened an the second attempt. I obviously have no way of proving this, but I suspect this is a 'stalling/blame shifting' tactic to buy time as it most commonly happens on a Saturday; you figure out the rest.\n\n**Note: In case it is relevant to the situation above, I live in a small town close enough to the P.O. that I don't get home delivery.**\nLike \u00b7 React \u00b7 More \u00b7 May 23", "Replies to Graciela's comment on US Postal Service's post View post", "Graciela Lourdes Martinez\nOn May 5th 2020, I place an order for USPS Stamps, Scooby Doo, I pay with a credit card and payment was accepted.

When I started I loved my job and when it ended I loved my patrons but post service mutated into something I could not imagine. The customer in customer service was totally removed from the equation. Management created an unbearable work environment. Slack offs were rewarded and workers were punished! I could go on and on. My regular sub for my off days was a total loser did nothing except sabotage my route and it would take me till my next day off to fix his deliberate mistakes. Guess what? Management did nothing. In part because they knew I was dedicated to my route and would fix the f--- up.Also PO hires 90 day wonders who either quit because they are pressured to do 12 hours work in 8 hours. Or rewarded with another 90 days. With no benefits. It is impossible to get quality competent workers in that environment. 98 % of the regulars who are still there are totally dedicated. For all the other reasons is why the public consider the USPS a present day failed and flawed system. Thank you for allowing to explain the situation.
